ABSTRACT 

in this paper 
learning = phenomenon of knowledge axquisition in the absence of explicit programming.

paper provides precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint.

methodology --> appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, exploring the class
of concepts that can be learned using it in a reasonable number of steps.

show u da cool stuff algorithmic complexity can learn even if it seems like it cant learn a lot. 

1. Introduction

computability theory --> became possible ONCE precise models were made for modeling the commonplace
phenomenon of mechanical calculation.
this evolved to explain the 1. human experience and 2. suggest how artificial computing devices
should be built

'learnability theory' --> learning merits simmilar attention like computing does.
1. discover good models that promise to be relevant to both explaining human experience and building devices 
that can learn. (and for funs sake)
2. The models should also shed light on the limits of what can be learned

ASSUMPTION: IN THIS PAPER WE SHALL SAY THAT A PROGRAM FOR PERFORMING
A TASK HAS BEEN ACQUIRED BY LEARNING IF IT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED BY ANY MEANS OTHER THAN 
EXPLICIT PROGRAMMING.


This paper is concerned with precise computational models of the learning phenomenon. We shall restrict ourselves to skills
that consist of recognizing whether a concept is true or not for given data.
::: WE shall say a concept Q has been learned if a program for recognizing it has been 
::: deduced (by some method other than the acquisition from the outside of the explicit programming)

MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER:
Shows that it is possible to design learning machines that have all three of the follow properties:
1. The machines can probably learn whole classes of concepts. (these classes can be characterized)
2. The classes of concepts are appropriate and nontribial for general-purpose knowledge
3. The computational process by which the machines deduce the desired programs requires a feasible number of steps


Learning machines consists of 
1. learning protocol --> specifies the manner in which information is obtained from the outside
2. deduction procedure --> mechanism by which a correct recognition algorithm for the concept to be learned is deduced.

At the BROADEST level the suggested methodology for studying learning:
1. Define a plausible learning protocol
2. Invesigate the class of concepts for which recognition programs can be deduced in polynomial time using the protocol
